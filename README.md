Pub/Sub with webpack Homework: Musical Instrument Families

Learning Objectives

Understand how to pass data between models and views using Pub/Sub
Be able to use the Pub/Sub pattern to build a modular front-end app
Brief

Your task is to create an app that allows a user to select an instrument family from a drop-down, and see information about it below. Implement the Pub/Sub pattern to separate your presentation and business logic into views and models.

MVP

Allow the user to select a musical instrument family from the drop-down and view the family's name and description
Extensions

In addition to displaying the name and description of the musical instrument family, also display a list of the musical instruments
Refactor your view code to implement small methods responsible creating sections of the UI.
Considerations

What are the responsibilities of the views and models? What is responsible for listening for the click of the menu item? What is responsible for finding the selected instrument family object? What is responsible for deciding how the instrument family details should be rendered?

Planning

Draw a diagram of your files, detailing the publishing of and subscribing to events and the flow of data through the application.

Note: Don't forget to create a .gitignore file
